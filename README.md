# Assignment-2-Django-Hello-World
Getting started with making a simple stand alone Django web project.

## In this assignment your website needs to do the following:

* Display "CINS465 Hello World"
* Be submitted to GitHub correctly

### Notes
* You should make sure your site is hosted such that it can be seen from the root path
  * If you were to visit the site on the local host it could be found at http://localhost/

## Submitting Assignment 2

If you haven't already create your CINS465 repo through the form on my website, you'll need the GitHub Token given out in lecture to do so.

You should upload all the project files to a folder called *Assignment_2* in that repository. You will be putting all your assignments for this class in that repository, except your final project which likely will have it's own repository.

You should make sure that your *manage.py* path in the repository is such that it can be reached via *./Assignment_2/manage.py*
