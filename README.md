# Assignment-2-Django-Hello-World
Getting started with making a simple stand alone Django web project.

## In this assignment your website needs to do the following:

* Display "CINS465 Hello World"
  * This should be done via a template variable
* Be submitted to GitHub correctly
  * Containerized is optional
  * Must be submitted to the correct branch
* You should be able to view the site on your local machine at http://localhost/. For more information on setting up routes in Django, please see [the documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/http/urls/)

## Submitting Assignment 2

If you haven't already create your CINS465 repo through the form on my website, you'll need the GitHub Token given out in lecture to do so.

The code should be submitted to your CINS465 on a branch named **assignment2**, make sure your case is identical for your branch or I may not find/grade your submission. 

You should have your code setup such that when cloned in your folder it can be run directly via **python manage runserver** or alternatively can be built into a docker container with a docker-compose or Dockerfile in the root directory.
